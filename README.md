## About the bug and supports

Since this exporter is designed for a very restricted purpose, I won't provide any support. The mesh, armature, and animation data must be created first to export the model properly.

## Changelog

1.0.2: Added the part ditingushing function by the vertex group it will store all vectices in the vertex group which is the name ends with "_mesh"
1.0.1: Separated the option "export model" to "export mesh" and "export armature". This is because the armature data is useless to armors.
	Changed the hidden joints not to be exported
1.0.0: Created
